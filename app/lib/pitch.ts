/**
 * Orangeboard outbound pitch writer — seller → advertiser email draft.
 *
 * The billboard OWNER pitches a nearby business on renting this board: where
 * the board is, why THIS advertiser fits (cluster context from the advertiser
 * engine), one visibility proof point, and a CTA to see the creative mockup.
 *
 * Failure chain (app never dead-ends):
 *   1. one chatJson() call → { subjectLine, pitch } (source: "llm")
 *   2. any failure (no key, timeout, bad JSON) → deterministic template
 *      built from the same inputs (source: "fallback")
 *
 * Honesty rule: visibility/cluster claims come in as pre-computed summaries;
 * the model is told to hedge anything modeled and never invent numbers.

const SYSTEM = `You write outbound emails FROM a billboard owner TO a local business, pitching them on advertising on the owner's billboard.
Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object — no prose, no markdown, no code fences. Shape:
{ "subjectLine": "short, specific, no clickbait", "pitch": "email body, max 150 words" }
Rules:
- Body must cover: where the board is, why THIS business specifically fits (use the nearby-business cluster context), one visibility proof point, and a CTA to view the creative mockup we made for them.
- Honest tone: cite only the numbers provided. If a figure is an estimate/model, hedge it ("our modeled estimate", "roughly"). Never invent statistics, prices, or guarantees.
- Warm, direct, zero marketing fluff. No placeholder brackets — write it ready to send.`;
